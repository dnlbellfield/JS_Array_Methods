// Description:
  // The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
// The Steps
  // 1 write requirements based on docs
  // 2 write description for test
  // 3 write test to fail
  // 4 write code to make the test pass
  // 5 repeat

Parameters

elementN
The elements to add to the end of the array.

Return value
The new length property of the object upon which the method was called.


push is intentionally generic. This method can be used with call() or apply() on objects resembling arrays. The push method relies on a length property to determine where to start inserting the given values. If the length property cannot be converted into a number, the index used is 0. This includes the possibility of length being nonexistent, in which case length will also be created.

Although strings are native, Array-like objects, they are not suitable in applications of this method, as strings are immutable.  Similarly for the native, Array-like object arguments.
